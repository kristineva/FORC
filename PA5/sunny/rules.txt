Here are the offical rules of Scrabble: The terminal version:

#1 The first player combines two or more of his or her letters to form 
a word and places it on the board to read either across or down with one
letter on the center square. Diagonal words are not allowed.

#2 Play passes to the left. The second player, and then each in turn,
adds one or more letters to those already played to form new words.
All letters played on a turn must be placed in one row across or down the
board, to form exactly one complete word.

#3 You may use a turn to exchange all of the letters. To do this, enter 'q'.
This will give you all new letters from the pool on your next turn. This ends
your turn.

#4 Any play is validated before it is placed on the board. If the word is
invalid, the player may try again until he discovers a valid play.
If he does not, he must press 'q' for a new set of letters on the next turn.

#5 The game ends when there are no more letters to draw.
